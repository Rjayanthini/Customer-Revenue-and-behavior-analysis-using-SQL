## Key Findings
- A small group of customers contributes a disproportionate share of total revenue
- High-value customers are concentrated primarily in the North and South regions
- A significant number of customers are inactive despite existing in the system

## Business Implications
- Retention efforts should focus on high-value customers to protect revenue
- Medium-value customers represent upsell opportunities
- Inactive customers require re-engagement campaigns or churn analysis

## Assumptions & Limitations
- Analysis is limited to the last 12 months
- Revenue is calculated using successful payments only
- Sample data represents simplified real-world behavior
